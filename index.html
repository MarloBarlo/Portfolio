        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Marlon Durand and I am a Computer science and Data science major at lyon College. I got into computer science when my brother introduced me into enginerring and after the movie Chappie. That sparked my intrest in coding and artifical intelligence. During my time in Lyon College I've been working in C++/C for most of my Computer science major and for my Data Science majoir Ive been using R and emacs.  </p>
        <p>I am passionate about software enginerring, machine learning, and data science. I'd like to eventually work as a Software enginer, Data scientist, or Reserch enginer for deep thinking modles and machine learning. Im currently looking foward to my internship with gainwell and the work I'd be doing with them. The internship is for the buisness analyst postion which is mainly working with datasets. I have been teaching myself python and refreshing on my sql to prepare for the postion.   </p>

        <p>Pokemon Dashboard</p>
        This project is an interactive dashboard using pokemon data from the 6th generation. I used the pokedex data from the games and made a dashboard that seperates them by primary and secondary typing, showing the amount of pokemon in each typing. The second aspect of the dashboard is a scatter plot which shows all the pokemon in the dataset and their total stats grouped by typing.

        <p>Machine Learning model using tweets</p>
        <p> I have another project in the works with a group. We are working on making regression models using twitter data. Im hoping the models manage to give an aproximation to how many views/impresions the tweet recived based off of likes, retweets, and comments. We had to srucb the data and then clean it by removing all the unimportant things we strictly were looking at tweets from the user not any thing they may have retweeted. </p>
